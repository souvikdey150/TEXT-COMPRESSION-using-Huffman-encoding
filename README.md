# TEXT-COMPRESSION-using-Huffman-encoding
Using the Huffman Coding technique, we can compress the string to a smaller size. Huffman coding first creates a tree using the frequencies of the character and then generates code for each character. Once the data is encoded, it has to be decoded. Decoding is done using the same tree.
